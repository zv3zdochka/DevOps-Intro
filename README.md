<details>
<summary>📋 Detailed Submission Process</summary>

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Fork the course repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```

3. **Create and work on your lab branch:**
   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/labX
   # Complete lab tasks, create submission files
   git add labs/submissionX.md
   git commit -m "docs: add labX submission"
   git push -u origin feature/labX
   ```

4. **Open PR from your fork → course repository main branch**
   - Navigate to the course repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select: `base: course-repo/main` ← `compare: your-fork/feature/labX`
   - Fill in the PR template with task completion checklist

5. **Copy the PR URL and submit via Moodle before deadline**

**⚠️ Important:** PRs must target the **course repository's main branch**, not your fork's main branch.

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

### Grade Composition

| Component | Points | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Required Labs (1-10)** | 80 points | 10 labs × 8 points each (80% of grade) |
| **Final Exam** | 20 points | Comprehensive assessment OR skip if both bonus labs completed |
| **Bonus Labs (11-12)** | +22 points max | Lab 11: 10 pts, Lab 12: 12 pts (capped at 22 total) |
| **Total Base** | 100 points | Required to pass: 60+ points |
| **Maximum Possible** | 122 points | With bonus labs (capped at 100% for final grade) |

### Performance Tiers

<details>
<summary>📈 Grading Scale</summary>

| Grade | Range | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **A** | 90-100+ | Mastery of core concepts, innovative solutions, exceptional documentation |
| **B** | 75-89 | Consistent completion, solid understanding, minor improvements needed |
| **C** | 60-74 | Basic competency demonstrated, needs reinforcement in some areas |
| **D** | 0-59 | Fundamental gaps, re-attempt required |

**Grade Calculation Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Standard Path (Labs + Exam)**
```
Required Labs: 72/80 points (9 labs at 8pts each)
Exam: 18/20 points
Total: 90/100 = A
```

**Scenario 2: Labs Only (80% Maximum)**
```
Required Labs: 80/80 points (perfect scores)
No Exam: 0/20 points
Total: 80/100 = B (cannot exceed 80% without exam/bonus)
```

**Scenario 3: Labs + Bonus (No Exam)**
```
Required Labs: 75/80 points
Bonus Lab 11: 10/10 points
Bonus Lab 12: 12/12 points
Total: 97/100 = A (bonus labs replace exam)
```

**Scenario 4: Maximum Score**
```
Required Labs: 80/80 points
Exam: 20/20 points
Bonus Labs: 22/22 points
Total: 122 points → capped at 100/100 = A+ with buffer
```

## ✅ Success Path

> **"Complete all 10 required labs to earn 80%. Add exam (20%) OR both bonus labs (22%) to reach higher grades. Maximum 122 points available, capped at 100% for final grade."**

<details>
<summary>💡 Tips for Success</summary>

**Lab Completion Strategy:**
1. **Weeks 1-10:** Focus on required labs first
2. **After Week 10:** Tackle bonus labs if time permits
3. Start each lab early - don't wait until the deadline
4. Read instructions thoroughly before beginning
5. Test all commands/code before documenting

**Prioritization:**
- **Must Do:** Labs 1-10 (required, gives 80% max)
- **Must Do One Of:**
  - Final exam (20 pts) OR
  - Both bonus labs (22 pts max)
- **Should Do:** Bonus labs to skip exam or boost grade
- **Nice to Have:** All components for maximum buffer

**Documentation Best Practices:**
1. Use clear Markdown formatting with headers
2. Include both outputs AND analysis
3. Explain WHY, not just WHAT you did
4. Screenshot key results for proof
5. Organize files logically in the lab folder

**Git Workflow:**
1. Always work on feature branches, never on main
2. Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `docs: add lab1 submission`)
3. Push regularly to avoid losing work
4. Open PRs to the course repository, not your fork
5. Review the PR checklist before submitting

**Time Management:**
1. Allocate 3-5 hours per required lab
2. Allocate 4-6 hours per bonus lab (more complex)
3. Break labs into manageable tasks
4. Use lab deadlines visible in Moodle
5. Review previous labs before starting new ones

**Bonus Lab Strategy:**
- Complete if you have time after required labs
- Prioritize if aiming for exam exemption
- Excellent for portfolio building
- Great for learning cutting-edge tech

**Getting Help:**
1. Review lab guidelines and examples
2. Check course documentation and resources
3. Discuss concepts with classmates (collaboration encouraged)
4. Attend office hours or ask on course forum
5. Submit questions early - don't wait until deadline
